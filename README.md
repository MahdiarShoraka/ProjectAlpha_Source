Project Alpha (Slash) - Unreal Engine 5 Action Adventure Game Prototype

Welcome to the source code repository for Project Alpha (Slash), a 3D Action RPG Game prototype developed in Unreal Engine 5. This project serves as a demonstration of my skills in crafting clean, scalable C++ code and implementing complex game logic and mechanics.

Throughout the development process, I focused on utilizing Unreal Engine 5's powerful frameworks and systems to create a professional and polished gameplay experience.

This project was part of my coursework from the Unreal Engine 5: The Ultimate Game Developer Course on Udemy.
