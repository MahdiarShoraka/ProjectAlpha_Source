Course Project from: https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-5-the-ultimate-game-developer-course (Udemy Online Course). \n
This Repository contains the source code for Slash, a 3D RPG Game made in Unreal Engine 5. This is my second project in UE5. 
The C++ source code in this Repository is written by me (originated from the course).
